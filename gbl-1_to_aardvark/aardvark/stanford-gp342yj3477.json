    "This polygon shapefile depicts periodic distribution for juvenile California Sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher). The process of creating this shapefile included creating contour lines, in 5-meter intervals, from bathymetry lines. Depth ranges were taken from four different references (see Resource Details Supplemental Information). After the depth range between which this species is most common was determined, they were rounded to the closest 5-meter interval. The deepest and shallowest shapefile lines were connected by a line at the northern end and southern end (determined by their geographical range from north to south). This shapefile was then converted to polygon. The goal of this shapefile was to provide a range in which this species could occur, given that their habitat is present. This coverage displays the geographic range of select Pacific Ocean fish species. California Department of Fish and Game. (2006).
