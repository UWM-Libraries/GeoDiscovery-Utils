    "This layer is a georeferenced image of a map of Shanghai that was published between 1904 and 1914. The map was dated with this range because it shows the Concordia Club, built after 1904, but it does not show the Russian Consulate, built in 1914. The map shows historical city data such as roads, parks, and select buildings. Virtual Shanghai is a research and resource platform on the history of Shanghai from the mid-nineteenth century to nowadays. It incorporates various sets of documents: essays, original documents, photographs, maps, quantitative data, etc. The objective of the project is to write a history of the city through the combined mobilization of these various types of documents. The implementation of this approach relies on the use of digital and GIS technologies. On the research side, the platform offers various ways to step into the history of the city and follow its course at different levels over time. On the resource side, apart from providing original textual and visual documents, it develops a powerful cartographic tool for spatial analysis and real-time mapping. The authors of the present project subscribe to the idea of sharing scholarship and research tools for the benefit of scholars, students, and citizens at large. Virtual Shanghai Project. (2018).
