    "This polygon shapefile contains the distribution of Mineral Resource Zones for Monterey County, California. Construction minerals such as sand, gravel, and stone are classified by the State Geologist into four mineral resource zones based on the likelihood of the presence of mineral deposits and their economic value. The areas that contain minerals that can be economically extracted are classified as MRZ 2 and are essential for supplying aggregate used in residential, commercial, and industrial building projects, as well as in public-works projects such as roads, bridges, and pipelines. This layer is part of a collection describing Geology resources and constraints Monterey County, California. The intended use of this map is to provide a mineral resource zonation for regional planning studies. Rosenberg, Lewis I. (2001). Mineral Resource Zones of Monterey County, California, 1999. Monterey County (Calif.) Planning Department. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/zz123dr9455. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
